angular-basicauth
=================

Simple module for managing authentication using basic authentication

Please note this module stores unencypted username & password in local-storage or cookies, so is
susceptible to attack from code from the same domain.

Also note that basic authentication sends usernames and passwords unencrypted in each request, so
should not be used when not using HTTPS protected transport.

For question about how to use this module, please email me.
